# piProject
Raspberry pi project. Containing setup of a headless pi3.


## Setup 
Download the latest raspbian lite at: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ (Or use a pre installed ubuntu server image from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi).
Either write the image using etcher(or another tool) or do it in the commandline.(i used etcher)

### Network setup
First we want to set a static ip for the computer we are using. create a new wired network with ip 192.168.0.1/24.

use nm-connection editor to make the network "shared with other computers" in ipv4 settings.

__1. Open a terminal__
## (IF USING RASBIAN)
open dhcpdc config file on the sd card and uncomment the default eth0 interface.
```
  nano /media/rootf/etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

make sure it looks like this. The most important part is that the routers is the same ip as the wired network on your computer.
```
interface eth0
        static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24
        static ip6_address=fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::ff/64
        static routers=192.168.0.1
        static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::1
```
## (IF USING UBUNTU Server)
Connect to the pi wired. This requires an ip from the Pi, this can be found with the program nmap: 
```
  nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24
```

now connect with ssh, as in step 2. Now setup the first time login. Now you have control over the pi, but no internet connection. To setup a internet through wired follow this: 

open /etc/netplan/XXX.yaml, with sudo nano and paste something like this: 
You need to paste you own network names, eg. eth0 and wlan0 can vary, so be sure that this is correct(This can be checked by running iwconfig and ifconfig). the wifi-name and password is should also be replaced by you wifi preferences.
```
network:
   version: 2
   ethernets:
      eth0:
         dhcp4: no
         addresses: [192.168.0.10/24]
         gateway4: 192.168.0.5
         nameservers:
            addresses: [8.8.4.4,8.8.8.8]
   wifis:
      wlan0:
         dhcp4: true
         dhcp6: true
         access-points:
           "WIFI-NAME":
              password: "PASSWORD"


```

now run 
```
  sudo netplan generate
  sudo netplan apply

```

and login to the pi again. You might need to update the known host file by running this command:
```
  sudo ssh-keygen -f "/root/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.0.10"
```

 and 
 https://askubuntu.com/questions/1105069/how-to-enable-wireless-on-ubuntu-server-18-04-via-cli

__2. connect to the pi(WIRED)__
The raspberry pi has a standard login, with the name "pi" and password "raspberry". 
Connect with ssh and enter the password:
```
  ssh pi@192.168.0.10
```

Now the pi should have internet connection through you laptop and are able to connect to the pi via ssh. if this is not the case, you did something wrong.

__3. connect to the pi wirelessly__

__(IF RUNNING RASBIAN)__
You need to have completed step 2 to complete this step.

On the pi run raspi-config:
```
  sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to network options and go into wi-fi to setup the wifi network.
Enter a SSID(wifi name) and the password. Now finish and aggree to reboot the pi. 
Now you should be able to connect via wifi to the pi. 

open ifconfig and locate the ip of the wifi network(often 192.168.X.X or 10.42.X.X).
```
  ifconfig
```
Now use nmap to search for other ip's on the network with the following command(exhange "WIFIIP" with the real ip, without the "").
```
  nmap -sP "WIFIIP"/24
```

The ip of the pi should pop up, locate it and connect with ssh and enter the password.

```
  ssh pi@"IP"
```

__(IF RUNNING UBUNTU Server)__
Check the referenced guide and start from step 4:

If raspi-config is needed install it using this StackOverflow question:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1130052/enable-i2c-on-raspberry-pi-ubuntuÂ½

__4. (OPTIONAL) change the password__
change password with the following cmd:
```
  sudo passwd
```
